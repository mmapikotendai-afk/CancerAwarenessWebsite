                                <p>"I discovered a small lump while bathing, but I ignored it for months. When I finally went to Parirenyatwa Hospital, they told me it was early-stage breast cancer. I was shocked, but the doctors and nurses stood by me. After surgery and chemotherapy, I'm now five years cancer free. My message is simple: Don't wait early detection saves lives."</p>

The word 'cancer' terrified me, but my doctors helped me fight back. Treatment was hard, but I made it through. Today, I work with a local women's group in Mpopoma teaching others to go for screening before it's too late."</p>

But my nurses told me: 'Rudo, cancer is not a death sentence.' I started treatment, lost my hair, but not my hope. Now I mentor other women through our support group in Dangamvura. Together, we are survivors."</p>

It was a long road, but I survived. The doctors and my mother never gave up. Today I'm a medical student at Midlands State University, studying to become a pediatric oncologist.

I went through surgery and chemo it was painful, but the love from my family and church kept me strong. I'm now three years cancer-free and share my story at local clinics so others can learn that faith and early treatment can heal."</p>

Cancer is not the end it's a fight that can be won with early detection, proper treatment, and community support. My joy is seeing patients return healthy and smiling."</p>

                                <p>"For years, I never went for screening because I thought cervical cancer only affected older women. When I finally visited Marondera Provincial Hospital for a routine check-up, I was told I had early-stage cervical cancer. I broke down in tears, but the nurses comforted me and explained that it was treatable. After months of treatment and prayer, I was declared cancer-free. Now, I encourage women in Dombotombo to get screened because I'm living proof that early detection saves lives."</p>

                                <p>"As men, we don't talk much about our health. When I started having pain and frequent urination, I ignored it. My wife insisted I go to Kadoma General Hospital, and that's where they found out it was prostate cancer. It was a tough journey, but I thank God and my doctors for saving me. Today, I speak at community meetings encouraging men to go for prostate screening. Cancer doesn't make you weak ignoring it does."</p>
